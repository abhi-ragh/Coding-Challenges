# Coding Challenges

Self Imposed Coding Challenges by myself and a few friends where we do a simple coding challenge every day to learn and get better at programming.

## Day 1 : Basic Calculator

Create a Simple Calculator that performs Operations like Addition , Subtraction , Multiplication and Division. The Program prompts the user for inputs and displays the Output.

## Day 2 : Palindrome Checker

Write a Python program that checks whether a given string is a palindrome or not. 

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequences of characters that reads the same forward and backward.

Should Return True For:
- malayalam
- Malayalam
- race car
- 12321

## Day 3 : Git Challenge 
 - Go to https://github.com/abhi-ragh/Git-Challenge
- Fork the repo

- Create a New Directory in your System
- Initialize To the forked Repo
- Create a New branch <Your Name>
- Create a New File: day3_challenge_<Your Name>.txt
- Add some text on the file
- Commit changes 
- Push the changes

- Go to Your Forked Repository on GitHub
- Create a Pull Request

- You should see a prompt to create a pull request for the branch you just pushed.
- Click on "Compare & pull request."
- Add a description of the changes you made and submit the pull request

## Day 4 : Simple To-Do App

Create a simple command-line To-Do list application in Python.

Requirements:
1. The program should allow the user to:
- Add a new task.
- View all tasks.
- Mark a task as complete.
- Remove a task.
   
2. Store the tasks in a list where each task is a dictionary containing:
- Task description
- Completion status (e.g., True for completed, False for incomplete)

3. The program should continue running until the user decides to exit.

## Day 5 : Travel Journal 

Create a simple Travel Journal Website

## Day 6 : Digital Business Card

Create a simple digital business card website

## Day 7 : One Line Calculator

Create a simple calculator in python using just one line of code

## Day 8 : Prime Checker

Write a Python program that checks if a given number is prime or not. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.

Requirements:

The program should take an integer as input.
Determine if the number is prime.
Print an appropriate message (e.g., "The number is prime" or "The number is not prime").

## Day 9: Simple Password Generator

Task:
Write a Python program that generates a random password based on user-defined criteria. The program should:
1. Ask the user for the desired length of the password.
2. Allow the user to specify if they want to include:
   - Lowercase letters
   - Uppercase letters
   - Digits
   - Special characters (e.g., !@#$%^&*())
3. Generate a random password based on the selected criteria.

Requirements:
- Ensure that the password contains at least one character from each selected category.
- The password should be randomly generated each time.

## Day 10: Number Guessing Game

Task: Create a number guessing game where the program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess it.

Requirements:

The program should give feedback whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
The user should be able to keep guessing until they get the correct number.
After the correct guess, show the number of attempts it took the user to guess the number.

## Day 11  Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

Task: Implement a command-line Rock-Paper-Scissors game where the user plays against the computer.

Requirements:

Choices: Allow the user to choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
Computer Move: Randomly generate a move for the computer.
Determine Winner: Compare the user’s choice with the computer’s choice and determine the winner.

## Day 12: Simple Portfolio Website

Create a simple portfolio website

## Day 13: Quiz Game

Create a simple text-based quiz game that asks the user a series of questions and provides feedback on their answers. The game should keep track of the score and display it at the end.

Objectives:
Present a series of questions to the user.
Allow the user to input their answers.
Keep track of the score based on correct answers.
Display the final score after all questions have been answered.

## Day 14: Mini Markdown Parser

Task: Create a simple Markdown parser that converts a few basic Markdown elements into HTML.

Requirements:

    Headings: Convert # Heading to <h1>Heading</h1> and \## Subheading to <h2>Subheading</h2>.
    Bold Text: Convert **bold** to <b>bold</b>.
    Italic Text: Convert *italic* to <i>italic</i>.
    Lists: Convert lines starting with - into unordered list items <li>.

## Day 15: Two Sum

Task: Write a function that takes an array of integers and a target sum. The function should return True if any two numbers in the array add up to the target sum, and False otherwise.

Requirements:

    - The function should take two arguments: an array of integers and a target integer.
    - Return True if any two distinct elements in the array sum to the target.
    - Return False if no such pair exists.

## Day 16: Reverse Words in a String

Task: Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the string with the words reversed.

Requirements:

- The function should reverse the order of words in the input string.
- Words are separated by spaces, and there should be no leading or trailing spaces in the output.

Example:
# Example 1
Input: "Hello World"
Output: "World Hello"

# Example 2
Input: "Python is fun"
