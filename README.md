# Coding Challenges

Self Imposed Coding Challenges by myself and a few friends where we do a simple coding challenge every day to learn and get better at programming.

## Day 1 : Basic Calculator

Create a Simple Calculator that performs Operations like Addition , Subtraction , Multiplication and Division. The Program prompts the user for inputs and displays the Output.

## Day 2 : Palindrome Checker

Write a Python program that checks whether a given string is a palindrome or not. 

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequences of characters that reads the same forward and backward.

Should Return True For:
- malayalam
- Malayalam
- race car
- 12321
- @# 1221 #@

## Day 3 : Git Challenge 
 - Go to https://github.com/abhi-ragh/Git-Challenge
- Fork the repo

- Create a New Directory in your System
- Initialize To the forked Repo
- Create a New branch <Your Name>
- Create a New File: day3_challenge_<Your Name>.txt
- Add some text on the file
- Commit changes 
- Push the changes

- Go to Your Forked Repository on GitHub
- Create a Pull Request

- You should see a prompt to create a pull request for the branch you just pushed.
- Click on "Compare & pull request."
- Add a description of the changes you made and submit the pull request

## Day 4 : Simple To-Do App

Create a simple command-line To-Do list application in Python.

Requirements:
1. The program should allow the user to:
- Add a new task.
- View all tasks.
- Mark a task as complete.
- Remove a task.
   
2. Store the tasks in a list where each task is a dictionary containing:
- Task description
- Completion status (e.g., True for completed, False for incomplete)

3. The program should continue running until the user decides to exit.
